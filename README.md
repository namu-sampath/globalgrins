# Global Grins
To start this off, I know this project isn't as good as it could have been. There are a number of reasons for this. 

I had to scrap the original project I wanted to pursue at the last minute as I wasn't able to find supporting data. I also did not have the visualization skills to make this look as appealing as I had envisioned. 

Complaining aside, I'm proud that I picked up some d3 skills during this project, and I am glad I stuck it out even through some pretty difficult challenges. 

## Let's talk about d3, baby 
For the d3 waffle chart I created, I went in knowing nothing. I had a vision in my head of what the graphic was going to look like, and I wanted to display a range of yellows => oranges displaying happiness as a gradient. In making the chart and the legend, I realized a few things are lacking from the chart and would be helpful to understand the context of the graphic. Firstly, annotations. I think it would be helpful for a reader to understand exactly what the context is for the chart. 

Secondly, I would have loved to have made the graphic interactive, so that readers could click through the chart and understand the breakdown of each of the squares. If given more time, I would love to puruse that. 

Additionally, I wasn't sure how to add my d3 graphic to my actual webpage, which is why it is a separate link altogether titled d3-wafflechart.html. I understand my file naming may be the reason why the d3 is not a part of the project's webpage. 

## The project 
I gathered the data I used for this project from the [World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/), whose data is powered by the Gallup World Poll data. There are a few missing pieces from the data: a. there are a number of countries that were not included in the 2022 data, b. there are many categories through which a country's happiness score is calculated, but no explanation for how those numbers are calculated or what the categories mean for people who don't regularly work with this data.
